The AI engineer successfully built and iterated on a travel planning application, TravelMate Pro. Initially, the broad scope of monitoring hotels, airfare, and car rentals was narrowed due to API limitations. The focus shifted to building a trip itinerary planner, which was successfully delivered with destination selection, interest-based planning, geographic clustering, and a responsive UI using FastAPI and React. Subsequent enhancements included a massive global destination expansion with solo female safety features and a comprehensive theme park planner integrating crowd and wait time data via thrill-data.com. The latest user request pivots away from Google Places and thrill-data, opting for public travel blogs for data and combining queue-times.com/waittimesapp for theme park data, indicating a shift towards more accessible or cost-effective data sources. The AI engineer is currently in the phase of integrating these new data sources.

The initial request was to build an application for continuous monitoring of availability and price on hotels, airfare, and car rentals from direct brand websites (e.g., hilton.com, united.com). It was to provide average trip prices, price fluctuation notifications, and allow users to select interests (outdoor, hiking, history, theme parks, family friendly) to build an itinerary based on length of trip.

Due to identified API limitations for direct brand integrations, the scope was refined to focus on a Travel Itinerary Builder. This evolved to include destination input, interest selection (scenic drives, hikes, beaches, theme parks, museums, historic landmarks, family friendly, dining hot spots, etc.), travel dates/duration input, and a day-by-day itinerary display with geographic clustering using mock data.

Further enhancements requested and implemented include:
- Massive destination expansion (50+ global cities, including under the radar places, excluding Russia/hostile areas).
- Addition of solo female as an interest, highlighting safe places.
- Integration-ready architecture for Google Maps/Places API and Firebase authentication.
- A Theme Park Planner to pull crowd levels and attraction wait times from thrill-data.com, allowing users to select parks/attractions and get expected wait times.
- Removal of the min safety rating dropdown, replaced with a city/geographic region list (3+ safety rating only).
- Ability for users to input specific cities or custom activities (e.g., Silverstone Racetrack in London).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure:


-   ****: This is the main FastAPI application entry point. Initially, it handled basic API routes. It has been significantly refactored, first by  into  and then integrated back, to support itinerary generation, destination lookup, and later, theme park data. It now includes logic for geographic clustering, solo female safety ratings, and custom activity integration.
-   ****: A new file created to hold the comprehensive database of global destinations, including safety ratings and details crucial for the solo female traveler feature and custom activity integration.
-   ****: A temporary file created during the enhancement phase, later its content was used to rewrite . It integrated the expanded destination data and new API endpoints.
-   ****: Contains the logic for interacting with theme park APIs (initially thrill-data.com). It handles data fetching, processing, and prediction logic for crowd levels and wait times.
-   ****: Defines FastAPI routes specifically for theme park functionality, integrating with  to expose park information, wait times, and crowd predictions.
-   ****: The main React component. This file has undergone multiple rewrites. Initially a base UI, it was rewritten by  to include the core itinerary builder. Later, it was updated to incorporate the  and  components, serving as the primary entry point for the TravelMate Pro application's two main features.
-   ****: Global styles for the frontend, primarily using Tailwind CSS. Rewritten to implement the beautiful, functional interface with gradients and professional design.
-   ****: A temporary file created to build the enhanced itinerary builder, including the expanded destination selection, solo female traveler features, and advanced filtering. Its content was integrated back into .
-   ****: A new React component developed to house the entire theme park planning interface, including park selection, attraction display, and wait time details.
-   ****: Python dependencies for the backend.  was added later after a  during theme park API testing.
-   ****: Contains frontend environment variables like .
-   ****: Contains backend environment variables like .

-   Integrate data from  and  to replace thrill-data.com for theme park wait times and crowd levels.
-   Obtain and configure Google Cloud API keys (Maps, Places APIs).
-   Obtain and configure Firebase configuration (web app config + Admin SDK service account JSON).
-   Obtain and configure  (or the new API keys for queue-times.com/WaitTimesApp).

<current_work>
The application, TravelMate Pro, is currently a fully functional travel planning platform. It features a comprehensive **Travel Itinerary Builder** capable of generating personalized day-by-day plans based on user interests, travel dates/duration, and smart geographic clustering. It supports over 50 global destinations across six continents, with a dedicated solo female interest category that includes safety ratings (only 3+ safety rated destinations are shown) and detailed safety notes for each location. Users can also input custom activities (e.g., Silverstone Racetrack in London) to be included in their itineraries, which are visually identified in the plan.

Additionally, a robust **Theme Park Planner** has been integrated. This feature allows users to select major theme parks (Magic Kingdom, Universal Studios Florida, Disneyland Park) and view real-time crowd levels and attraction wait times. It provides intelligent tour optimization, suggesting peak times and best visit times, with categories for thrill levels, FastPass/Lightning Lane indicators, and height requirements.

The backend is built with FastAPI and MongoDB, handling complex logic for itinerary generation, destination management, and theme park data integration. The frontend is a responsive React application styled with Tailwind CSS, offering a professional and intuitive user experience.

However, the application relies on mock data or has placeholder integrations for certain real-time data aspects. The user has just requested a significant change in data sourcing:
-   Replacing **Google Places API** with data gathered from **public travel blogs**.
-   Replacing **thrill-data.com** integration with a combined data source from **queue-times.com** and **WaitTimesApp** for theme park information.

The AI engineer has successfully obtained the integration playbooks for queue-times.com and WaitTimesApp and is now in the process of implementing the travel blog scraping system. This indicates the current state is mid-re-integration of core data sources.
